# Soccer-Match-Analysis


<p align="justify"> This is a report given to the class "Experiment Design in Computer Science", taught by Professor Claus Aranha
  during Master's course in Computer Science in the University of Tsukuba in 2022. You can find more info about this course

  This report aims to investigate the results of soccer games regarding the win-ratio of soccer
teams in each place they play. That is, analyze the ratio of wins for the home team and
compare different sets of positive results. A draw may or may not be a positive result, and for
this reason experiments are done by considering all possible roles for it: draw as a negative
result, positive result and not considering draw in the analysis.
</p>
<p align="justify"> 
It is expected by the end of this experiment to have ratios of positive results against negative
results for the home team and determine with a certain level of confidence an interval of
percentage of games that the home team obtains a positive result in different considerations
for a draw.
